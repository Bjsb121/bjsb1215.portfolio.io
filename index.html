        <div class="description1">My name is Bryan Schmidt, and I am a novice computer coder from Canada. I was born in Paraguay,
           but was raised in Canada. I also lived in Spain for 12 years, as my parents worked there. I have always loved technology
            and have had a knack for that sort of thing. In high school I was in charge of sound and lights for all the major
             productions they had, and after I graduated high school and started working, I had two jobs: the first was plasma
              cutting, using a computer to input codes to cut the metal, and the second was robotic welding, which also had to do
               with inputting code into a computer for a robot to weld accordingly.</div>

        <div class="description2">I started coding because I realized that this is going to be a large part of the future of the
           world and I want to be a part of it. My brother-in-law got into it a few months before I did, so he really helped me start
            out, and even now we help and motivate each other. I am studying to be a front-end developer right now, but eventually
             I want to be able to do what a full-stack developer does. I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given
              with CodeAcademy, and I can’t wait to keep taking full advantage of it.</div>
